                <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy
                    emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs
                    as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small
                    and large-scale projects.</p>
                <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming
                    language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
                    introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference
                    counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not
                    completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2
                    was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020</p>
                <p>It is used for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>web development (server-side),</li>
                    <li>software development,</li>
                    <li>mathematics,</li>
                    <li>system scripting.</li>

                <header>python syntax</header>
                <p>The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines how a Python program
                    will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system and by human readers). The Python
                    language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java. However, there are some definite differences
                    between the languages.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
                <header>hello world</header>
                <p>To get started with writing Python, open the IDLE and write your first "Hello world" Python code:</p>
                <code>print("hello world")</code>
                <p>Then you need to save the file with .py extention. After that you can run you porgramme. To execute
                    the file in IDLE, simply press the F5 key on your keyboard. You can also select Run → Run Module
                    from the menu bar. Either option will restart the Python interpreter and then run the code that
                    you've written with a fresh interpreter.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="variables">
                <header>variables</header>
                <p>A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a
                    variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.</p>
                <p>Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers,
                    List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc. Variables can be declared by any name or even
                    alphabets like a, aa, abc, etc</p>

            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="declareing_variables">
                <header>declareing variables</header>
                <p>Let see an example. We will declare variable "a" and print it.</p>
                <code>a=100 <br> print(a)</code>
                <p>this will print 100 which is the value of the variable 'a'</p>
                <p>You can re-declare the variable even after you have declared it once.</p>
                <code>a=100<br>print(a) <br> a=’AECS Jaduguda’<br>print(a)</code>
                <p>the output would be like this:</p>
                <code>100 <br>AECS Jaduguda</code>

                <code>= x = 25 Value 25 is assigned to x <br>
              += x += 25 This is same as x = x + 25 <br>
              -= x -= 25 Same as x = x – 25<br>
              *= x *= 25 This is same as x = x * 25<br>
              /= x /= 25 Same as x = x / 25<br>
              %= x %= 25 This is identical to x = x % 25<br>
              //= x //= 25 Same as x = x // 25<br>
              **= x **= 25 This is same as x = x ** 25<br>
              >>= x >>= 25 Same as x = x >> 25</code>
